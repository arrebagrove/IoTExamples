Examples with XAML and C# for W10 IoT

<b>RGB Led</b>

At this moment you can set the GPIO Pins to high and low, this is an example on how to change the color using the current GpioPin class.

<b>Basic Thermometer</b>

Using a capacitor and two GPIOS you can measure the changes of the resistance of a thermistor by measuring the time that takes the capacitor to charge or discharge.

In this case you can connect directly to the raspberry Pi 2 this L9110 (controller chip) Fan Motor and make the motor forward, reverse and stop just by setting GPIOs high and low

I have improved the code to implement Hardware HVVH pattern.
